# JavaScript Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository! This is where I document my journey to improve my JavaScript skills through coding exercises.

## Practice Log

Here, I will log my progress and notes on what I've worked on.

### Practise session 1: [27-9-23]
- Worked on a form validation script.
- Implemented validation to ensure that both passwords match.
- Validated for null values in the name, password, and email fields.
- Employed regular expressions to validate email format.

### Practise session 2 [29-9-23]:
- Worked on functions like trim and length to validate spaces.
- Continued to enhance understanding of external script inclusion by adding JavaScript functions from external files.

### Practise session 3 [30-9-23]:
I have learned about builtin functions.
One of the key practical applications of these string manipulation functions is in form handling. Here's how they can be used in a web form:

- **`trim`**: Use `trim` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from user input. This ensures that user-entered data doesn't have unintended spaces that can cause validation issues.

- **`split`**: `split` can be employed to break a user's input into an array of values based on a delimiter. This is useful for parsing multi-value inputs, such as tags or email addresses.

- **`toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase`**: These functions help standardize user input by converting it to lowercase or uppercase, making it easier to compare and validate.

- **`replace`**: `replace` allows you to replace specific characters or patterns in user input. This is useful for tasks like sanitizing input or formatting it consistently.
