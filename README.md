# JavaScript Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository! This is where I document my journey to improve my JavaScript skills through coding exercises.

## Practice Log

Here, I will log my progress and notes on what I've worked on.

### Practise session 1: [27-9-23]
- Worked on a form validation script.
- Implemented validation to ensure that both passwords match.
- Validated for null values in the name, password, and email fields.
- Employed regular expressions to validate email format.

### Practise session 2 [29-9-23]:
- Worked on functions like trim and length to validate spaces.
- Continued to enhance understanding of external script inclusion by adding JavaScript functions from external files.

### Practise session 3 [30-9-23]:
I have learned about builtin functions.
One of the key practical applications of these string manipulation functions is in form handling. Here's how they can be used in a web form:

- **`trim`**: Use `trim` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from user input. This ensures that user-entered data doesn't have unintended spaces that can cause validation issues.

- **`split`**: `split` can be employed to break a user's input into an array of values based on a delimiter. This is useful for parsing multi-value inputs, such as tags or email addresses.

- **`toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase`**: These functions help standardize user input by converting it to lowercase or uppercase, making it easier to compare and validate.

- **`replace`**: `replace` allows you to replace specific characters or patterns in user input. This is useful for tasks like sanitizing input or formatting it consistently.

  ### Practise session 4 [5-10-23]:
  Problem: To identify the duplicate element in an array and to store them separately.
  I have learned two new methods in js using that i solved this.
  
- **`indexof()`**: The `indexOf()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in an array.
  
Usage in Solving the Problem: By iterating through the original array and using `indexOf()`, we can check if an element already exists in the result array (which stores unrepeated elements).
If it does not exist, the element is added to the result array; otherwise, it is considered a duplicate and is stored separately.

**Return Value of indexOf():** The indexOf() method returns the first index at which the specified element can be found in the array, or -1 if the element is not found.

- **`includes()`**: The includes() method checks if an array includes a certain element, returning **true** if found and **false** otherwise.
  
- Additionally i have solved using **nested-for**
